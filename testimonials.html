The extensive menu has the Vietnamese basics  like spring rolls, eggrolls ,  banh mi ( baguette sandwiches) , noodles, rice dishes and stir-fries.  
Here are just a few  dishes that customers like a lot!

          <i><p>I am a huge fan of Vietnamese cuisine and really wanted to find a good Vietnamese restaurant and Banh Mi place near my work. I checked here 
		  on Google and find out Vietnam Kitchen. I went to try it for the first time and was instantly a fan.</p>

          <p>The restaurant is small and more of a take out place. However, there is nothing small about the courtesy of the employees and taste of the 
		  food. I grabbed a order of Spaghetti Basil and a Spam and BBQ pork Banh Mi. They were both amazing but the Spaghetti Basil was really the 
		  show stopper. The flavors of the Spaghetti Basil and portion size was great for the price.</p>
		  
		  <p>Definitely a great find!!</p>

          <p>Make sure to try the Spaghetti Basil!</p>

          <i><p>I was introduced to Vietnam Kitchen by a friend who catered her birthday party with them. Food was very fresh and flavorful. Since then, 
		  
		 I have gone back for take out and have always been really happy about their service, friendliness and quality of food. The staff is always 
		 helpful and super friendly.</p>

          <p>Ordering over the phone is really convenient and it’s ready to pick up in less than 15 minutes for a dinner order. Their prices can be a 
		  little higher than other Vietnamese restaurants, but quality is better and the customer service is awesome. Also they are a family restaurant 
		  who also own Pho Ba Co down the street, so I love to support local places when I can!

		  <p>Delicious food!!</p>

        <i><p>I went to chef Ed Lee’s book signing and this was on the Louisville area restaurants he recommended. So I wanted to try it out. It was really good, 
        I got the Pho Ga. It was great, would definitely like to come back and try some more of their dishes. The employees were really nice as well. Enjoy 
		your dishes but leave room for their dessert drinks, they are awesome!</p>
